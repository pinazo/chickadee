chickadee
=========


A hyperlocal context associations store
---------------------------------------

chickadee is a contextual associations store.  Specifically, it associates wireless device identifiers with either metadata or human-friendly place names.  In other words it maintains, for instance, the link between your wireless device and your online stories so that Smart Spaces which detect your device can understand what you're sharing about yourself.  Why the name?  The [Cornell Lab of Ornithology explains](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/black-capped_chickadee/lifehistory): "The Black-Capped Chickadee hides seeds and other food items to eat later. Each item is placed in a different spot and the chickadee can remember thousands of hiding places."  Not only does it have an outstanding associative memory, it is also "almost universally considered _cute_ thanks to its oversized round head, tiny body, and curiosity about everything, including humans."

If you were entrusting a bird to associate your wireless device with your online stories you'd want it to be cute and friendly enough to eat out of your hand, right?  We could have named this package [Clark's Nutcracker](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/clarks_nutcracker/lifehistory), the bird with arguably the best associative memory, but the whole nut-cracking thing doesn't inspire the same level of friendliness now does it?

One more fun fact that we feel compelled to pass along: "Every autumn Black-capped Chickadees allow brain neurons containing old information to die, replacing them with new neurons so they can adapt to changes in their social flocks and environment even with their tiny brains."  Wow, that's database efficiency that we can aspire to!


Installation
------------

    npm install chickadee


Hello chickadee
---------------

```javascript
var chickadee = require('chickadee');
var associations = new chickadee();
```


RESTful interactions
--------------------

Include _Content-Type: application/json_ in the header of all interactions in which JSON is sent to chickadee.

__GET /devices/id/association__

Retrieve the association for the device with the given id.  For example querying the id _001bc50940100000_ via /devices/001bc50940100000/association would generate a response similar to the following:

    {
      "_meta": {
        "message": "ok",
        "statusCode": 200
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://localhost:3004/devices/001bc50940100000/association"
        }
      },
      "devices": {
        "001bc50940100000": {
          "url": "http://myjson.info/story/test",
          "href": "http://localhost:3004/devices/001bc50940100000"
        }
      }
    }

__PUT /devices/id/association__

Update or create a device association.  For example, to update a device with identifier 001bc50940100000, PUT /devices/001bc50940100000/association and include the updated JSON, for example:

    { "url": "http://myjson.info/story/lonely" }

A successful response will be similar to the following:

    {
      "_meta": {
        "message": "ok",
        "statusCode": 200
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "http://localhost:3004/devices/001bc50940100000/association"
        }
      },
      "devices": {
        "001bc50940100000": {
          "url": "http://myjson.info/story/lonely",
          "href": "http://localhost:3004/devices/001bc50940100000"
        }
      }
    }

If the static device identifier does not already exist, it will be created similar to POST /id.

__DELETE /devices/id/association__

Delete a device association.

__POST /places__

Create a new place.  For example, to create a place named _birdnest_ with two infrastructure devices having ids 001bc50940800000 and 001bc50940810000, and an association with the url [http://myjson.info/story/test](http://myjson.info/story/test) include the following JSON:

    {
      "name": "birdnest",
      "devices": [ { "id": "001bc50940800000", "type": "infrastructure" },
                   { "id": "001bc50940810000", "type": "infrastructure" } ],
      "url": "http://myjson.info/story/test"
    }

__PUT /places/place__

Update a place association.  For example, to update a place named _birdnest_, PUT /places/birdnest and include the updated JSON, for example:

    {
      "devices": [ { "id": "001bc50940800001", "type": "infrastructure" },
                   { "id": "001bc50940810001", "type": "infrastructure" } ]
    }

__GET /places/place__

Retrieve the association for the given place.  For example, the place named _test_ would return:

    {
      "_meta": {
        "message": "ok",
        "statusCode": 200
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:3004/places/test"
        }
      },
      "places": {
        "test": {
          "devices": [
            { "id": "001bc50940800000", "type": "infrastructure" },
            { "id": "001bc50940810000", "type": "infrastructure" }
          ],
          "href": "http://localhost:3004/places/test"
        }
      }
    }

__DELETE /places/place__

Delete a place.

__PUT /places/place/devices/id__

Update a device associated with the given place.  For example, to add device 001bc50940800000 to a place named _birdnest_, PUT /places/birdnest/devices/001bc50940800000 and include the updated JSON, for example:

    { "device": { "type": "infrastructure" } }

__DELETE /places/place/devices/id__

Delete a device associated with the given place.


Implicit Associations
---------------------

The following implicit associations are supported.  In other words, the implicit _url_ will be provided unless the device is already uniquely associated, via its identifier, with a _url_.
